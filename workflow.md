## Workflows

The following are workflows for OpenStax content. We transition states to produce high quality content and visually appealing artifacts for the end consumer.

At any point in time the content can be in multiple final states, known in this document as a "Public" state, which simply means that even if the content item is still transitioning through other sub-states its major state is visible to the public to some degree. Contrary to that is the "Drafting" major state, which simply means that the content item is only visible and accessible to those drafting it.


### Major states of visibility and access

As previously stated the two major states of visibility and access are Public and Drafting. The Drafting state typically starts with a newly identifyable (e.g. by name 'errata-foo-bar' or uuid) content item makes it visible and accessible to the creator and others in the ACL. (At this time there is no reason a draft needs to blocked from annonymous viewing. TBD)

The Public state is typically seen as the "end state" or publically consumable state, where the content item is visible and accessible by annonymous consumers.

The Public state for OpenStax books is usually the point where a versioned item is created and kept for historic use. Though, this is a technical detail that should not be focused on. It's mentioned here only to bridge the understanding with what currently exists.

### Editing Workflow

An item of content is "Public" in its final state of "Accepted Publication" (for legacy content) or "Baked Publication" (all content in the future). When one starts the *Editing workflow* at "Drafting" the item of content is created or copied. That new item of content is then put into the "Drafting" state.

### PDF Workflow

An item of content is "Public" in its final state of "Accepted Publication" (for legacy content) or "Baked Publication" (all content in the future). When one starts the *PDF workflow* at "PDF Artifact Review" the item of content is unmodified as this workflow annotates rather than creates.

Note, whether or not the system can handle two or more items of the same content at any time is a technical detail outside the scope of this document.

## A3 Planning

A3 planning is a technique created by Toyota and Lean manufacturing. The idea
is to focus on a problem and convey all the information necessary in an A3 
size of paper (11.69 x 16.53 inches). However,  it's not the size of the paper 
that is important but rather the approach to solving the problem and
conveying the right information to the people that need it.
